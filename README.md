## Welcome to My Data Science Playground! 👩‍💻📊

Hello there! 👋 I'm Shareen, a passionate data scientist and explorer of the vast realms of data. This is my corner on GitHub where I tinker with code, analyze datasets, and turn raw numbers into meaningful insights.

### About Me

- 📈 I specialize in data analysis, machine learning, and visualization.
